# TLops_R_All_In_One
A collection of scripts created for Stats 314 at OSU  
The All-In-One contains a bunch of functions that you can run on data sets to pull metrics slightly faster than typing each command by hand. 
The summary() funcntion does something simmilar, this just has a little more info and goes out a few extra decimal places for tophat assignments.
The other scripts contain code neccessary for each week's assignment. While the assignment can easily be completed by just copy-pasting from canvas,
this consolidates everything into one file to help streamline the process. 

This repo is updated almost every week, and I try to publish relevant code before each assignment is due. 

Please note that this code is written based on the assignments for the Spring 2023 section of ST 314 with Erin Howard. While it's likely that this will be
relevant for other or future sections, I can't garuntee anything.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or issues with the code via the "ISSUES" or "DISCUSSIONS" sections on github.
